<p>I started with the demo jupyter-book and started to delete pages I didn't want.</p>
<p>I creaetd a new project repository and set GitHub pages to look for the source in the <code>master</code> branch. 
This means that the url is <code>cranmer.github.io/intro-exp-phys-book</code>. 
That didn't work at first, that URL was redirected to the <code>introduction.html</code> landing page automatically.
Later I realized I needed to modify the <code>_config.yml</code> file to be:</p>

<pre><code>baseurl: "/intro-exp-phys-book" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog. If there is no subpath for your site, use an empty string ""
url: "https://cranmer.github.io" # the base hostname &amp; protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com</code></pre>
<p>Now it's working.</p>
